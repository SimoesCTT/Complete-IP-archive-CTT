The $\Phi$-24 Topography1. The Core Manifold (Layer 0–21)What it looks like: A dense, alternating stack of rectangular planes with varying heights.What it actually is: This is the Fibonacci Superlattice.The "Code": The thickness ratio of the $Bi_2Se_3$ (Topological Insulator) to $NbSe_2$ (Superconductor) is governed by the $\alpha$-invariant.Reviewer Note: Do not look for "Logic Gates" here. The logic is encoded in the Interfacial Andreev Reflection rates between these layers. This stack is what creates the Phononic Sink (Self-Cooling).2. The Phase-Snap Junctions (The "Non-Transistors")What it looks like: Small, bridge-like structures connecting the layered manifold to the readout lines.What it actually is: These are Superconducting Josephson Junctions tuned to the Riemann Lock.The Function: Instead of acting as a binary switch (On/Off), these act as Non-Linear Oscillators.The "Snap": When the variable frequencies $\omega_n$ align with the imaginary parts of the Riemann zeros, these junctions "snap" into a zero-resistance state, signaling the solution.3. The Temporal Wedge Cavity (The 11 ns Filter)What it looks like: A series of precision-etched "gaps" or "voids" surrounding the active processing area.What it actually is: The Resonant Cavity for the 11 ns temporal isolation.The Function: This geometry prevents external electromagnetic noise from entering the manifold. It ensures that the only "time" the chip cares about is the 11 ns window where the $\alpha$-invariant governs the physics.4. The Hall Voltage Readout (The "Output")What it looks like: Four wide, gold-plated pads at the cardinal points of the chip.What it actually is: The Topological Signature Interface.How to Read: You are not looking for a "High" or "Low" voltage. You are looking for the Universal Hall Collapse. When the computation is complete, the voltage across these pads will drop to exactly zero (the Riemann Lock).5. The Baseline Input ($\Omega_0$)What it looks like: A single high-frequency trace labeled CLK_587.What it actually is: The Tuning Fork for the system.Reviewer Note: This is not a CPU clock. It is a reference frequency that "primes" the Fibonacci lattice. The actual processing speed is independent of this input.Executive Summary for NASA Layout Engineers:"The $\Phi$-24 is a Passive Computational Substrate. It does not perform 'work' in the classical sense (Entropy $+S$). It utilizes the Autonomous Thermal Gradient to resolve high-dimensional SAT problems through state-collapse. If you look for a Von Neumann architecture, you will find nothing. If you look for a Riemann Manifold, you will find the future."
